# DESCRIPTION:
RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is the internal memory in the computerâ€™s CPU which stores different types of data and information as per the requirement. Moreover, we can also call it the main memory, primary memory, or read/write memory. RAM stores all the data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program. Moreover, it is a volatile memory i.e. it loses data as soon as the power is cut off. Besides, as per its name, the data access is in a random manner. This means that we can access any random location in the memory without even knowing the address of the previous location. Since RAM is a volatile memory hence, a backup is present in most of the systems in the form of an uninterrupted power supply (UPS). Moreover, the speed and performance of a system are directly proportional to the size of RAM.
SRAM: The word static denotes that the data stays in the memory but only till the power supply is ON. Furthermore, it is a chip having 6 transistors and no capacitors. The SRAM uses more chips than the DRAM for the same storage amount. And hence the cost of manufacturing is greater than that of a DRAM.
DRAM: In this memory, we have to refresh it, again and again, to store the data. Furthermore, it performs this task by placing memory on the refresh circuit which rewrites the data many times.
